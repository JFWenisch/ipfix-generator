### Overview
This IPFIX (IP Flow Information Export) Generator is a tool designed to create and send IPFIX traffic for testing, demonstration, and analysis purposes. It simulates network flow data by generating IPFIX packets, which can be used to test network monitoring systems, analyze network performance, and ensure the accuracy of flow data collection.


The IPFIX Message Generator is a versatile tool designed for generating IPFIX (IP Flow Information Export) messages for testing purposes. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use and can also be accessed via its API and REST endpoints.

### Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: User-friendly interface for generating and managing IPFIX messages.

- **API Access**: Programmatic access to generate IPFIX messages via REST Endpoints allowing integration with other tools and systems.

- **Customizable Parameters**: Configure various parameters for IPFIX message generation.

please create a github readme for my project. It generates ipfix messages for testing purposes and has a graphical interface and can also be used via it's API and REST
